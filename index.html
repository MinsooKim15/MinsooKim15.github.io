            This project used interactive slideshow as narrative visualization structures from three structures <br>
            Users can click the buttons on the bottom of the page to move around the page to see the scenes <br>
            Such as relationship between birth rate, GDP per capita and total GDP. <br>
            Users can see the current scene and detailed information on the top title section<br>

        <p>
            South korea, my home country üá∞üá∑ is experiencing serious decrease of birth rate.
            <br>
            Some experts says passimistic opinion that this decrease of birth rate will lead to the 'extinction' of the country.
            <br>
            I was curious wheter this serious decrease of birth rate is normal between similar countries with GDP and life expectancy. 
            <br>
            I have found there are certain relavance between GDP(per capita and total GDP) and birth rate.
            <br>
            As the country experience economic growth, usually there birth rate drops.
            <br>
            Also as the life expectancy becomes higher(which is another indicator how the country is good enough live in the part of safety and pulic insurance.), the birth rate might change.
            <br>
            I wanted to communicate this trends around the countries to more accurately find how the country is experiencing the birth rate.

            Narrative Structure: Interactive Slideshow

            Users can follow the buttons from left to right to follow the ‚Äústeps‚Äù as it goes to the next pages. <br>
            This is
            interactive slideshow because there are a little bit ‚Äúdrill-down‚Äù pages to narrow down or provide details of
            <br>
            certain country‚Äôs birth rate trend.<br>

            Visual Structure:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Each scene is consist of two parts, "description section" which explains about the data and the "graph section" which shows the detailed graph.
            <br>
            This visual structure is contestant across this narrative visualization project. <br>
            Viewers can understand the data by reading the texts in X and Y axis, and description section on top<br>
            There are also tooltips and annotations for users to follow, so they can stay focused on the<br>
            presented data on each scene.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>
            Scenes:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Scenes contain 1 description section(contains title of the data, description and key message) and 1 graph section(which shows different graph suitable for each key message)<br>
            All 3 scenes use a consistent format avoid viewers to get confused.<br>
            The annotation template contains texts and pointers to pinpoint the location that I would like to
            emphasize<br>

        <h2>
            Parameters:
        </h2>
        <p>
            My parameters are variables, which is chart years, country name and birth rate of charts and used as options to drill down the chart.<br>

        </p>
        <h2>
            Triggers:
        </h2>
        <p>
            My triggers are button, drop down menu and mouse over. 
            Buttons are used as a connector to the next chart or page to change the parameters.<br>
            Dropdown menus are used as a selector for specific country name<br>
            Mouseover are the trigger to show the tooltips which show the detailed information above the bubble chart and scatter plot.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>
            Data Source
        </h2>
        <p>
            WDI(World Development Index) data from <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> was used.<br>
            Used "GDP Per capita","GDP","Life expectancy" and "Birth Rate" indicator from the data was used.<br>
            Some cleaning of data was preceded to fill Null values and to only show the countries(not some group of country as "OECD Members") on some of the scenes.
